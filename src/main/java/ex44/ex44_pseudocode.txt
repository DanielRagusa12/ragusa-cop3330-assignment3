For exercise 44 I will start by declaring an array list for name, price, and quantity.
I will then create a new file for the input.json file.
I will then create a Json parser reader for the json file, and create a jsonArray that will locate the "products" array int the json file.
After this I will create a loop to read through the json array and store name,price, and quantity in the above array lists.
I will then prompt for user input inside a loop, and pass the name of the product being searched for to my search_product function.
This function will loop through the name array list, and if it finds a match it will print out the name, price, and quantity of that item.
If this is done the function will return true, allowing the loop in main to break.
If no product is found, the function will print a message to the user, and the loop in main will not break.
