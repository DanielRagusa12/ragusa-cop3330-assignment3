For exercise 45 I will start by using a buffered reader to read each line of the input file into an array list.
I will then pass this array list to a word_replace function that will increment through the arraylist.
The loop inside this function will be checking for the word "utilize" and when found replaces it with "use".
The function will then return a new array list with "use" substituted appropriately.
Once main receives the sorted array it will use it to write to the output txt file.
